## Overview

[MaveDB](https://www.mavedb.org/) is a biological database for Multiplex Assays of Variant Effect (MAVE) datasets, such as those generated by Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS) or Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA).  The software in this repo generates content for the **Variant Effect Maps** track hub, which renders MaveDB assay results mapped against the Hg38 reference genome.  This software relies on the mappings of the raw MaveDB scores from the original reference sequences to the canonical human reference sequences, building upon mappings generated by [Arbesfeld et al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.20.545702v1).

## Prerequisites

This software relies on the [cool-seq-tool](https://pypi.org/project/cool-seq-tool/) python package to map protein to genomic coordinates.  The cool-seq-tool package in turn relies on the [Universal Transcript Archive (UTA)](https://github.com/biocommons/uta) database, the [SeqRepo](https://github.com/biocommons/biocommons.seqrepo) sequence mapping resource, and other resources.  See the installation instructions for [cool-seq-tool](https://pypi.org/project/cool-seq-tool/) for more information.
